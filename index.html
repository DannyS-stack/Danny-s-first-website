            <h2>Nice to meet you</h2>
            <p>My name is Danny Spaans, let me tell you something about myself. I am 25 years old and I have been living
                in The
                Netherlands all my life. I live together with my parents and my dog in an apartement in Purmerend. After
                not completing my HBO public administration I got demotivated and didn't really start anything new. I
                just
                worked some different minimum wage jobs but what was always nagging at me is that I knew I was not
                really fulfilling my potential. I've been wanting to get a proper career for a long time but never knew
                what direction I wanted to go in until I started coding. I did some online courses but realised it would
                be good for me to do a bootcamp to really kickstart my programming career. Looking forward to meeting
                all of you, below are some of my hobbies and my contact information. Feel free to message or add me!</p>

                        <h4>Dungeons & Dragons</h4>
                        <p> You might have heard of it, or not. It's the most popular "tabletop roleplaying game" but if
                            you dont know it that still doesn't say much. You basically create a character with certain
                            strengths and weaknesses and roll dice to overcome problems. Its kind of like playing an
                            rpg on the computer, but sitting around a table with actual people makes it just so much
                            more fun.

                        <h4>Meditation</h4>
                        <p> I practice meditation and yoga daily, I feel like meditation really improves
                            quality of
                            life by making you more calm and focussed. The point of meditation is to become more aware
                            of your thoughts and the goings-on of your mind. It allows you to see whats going on in your
                            mind without getting too involved in it. It's a great thing and it's getting
                            increasily more popular. I also like to read the philosphy of the religions associated with
                            yoga and meditation but would not call myself religious. </p>

                        <p>A very recent addition to my array of things I like, I only found out that I liked this
                            during lockdown. Always thought you had to be some math genius or tech-wiz to understand it
                            and never looked twice at it. Turns out it can be taught to mere mortals. So here I am. </p>

                            <p> Another Tabletop game, a "tabletop wargame" this time. Very different from Dungeons and
                                Dragons mentioned earlier. In this hobby you collect expensive miniatures from one of
                                many stylistically and functionally different armies and play a tactical wargame against
                                another human doing the same. </p>

                            <p>The miniatures that I bought to play warhammer 40k introduced me to another hobby,
                                miniature painting. It's closely tied with warhammer 40k but it's an entire hobby in and
                                of itself. I have gotten to a pretty decent level of painting myself but there are
                                miniature painters out there who create nothing less than art. Check

                            <p>I also love reading, but I have too many hobbies and don't spend much time on this. I
                                usually read in public transport when going to work or school. I also enjoy listening to
                                audiobooks while painting miniatures. I mostly read fantasy or science fiction books and
                                sometimes non fiction if its a subject I'm interested in. </p>
